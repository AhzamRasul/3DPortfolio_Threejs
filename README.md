## Introduction

Creating scrollable 3D animations can add depth and interactivity to your web projects. This project provides a boilerplate for setting up a basic scroll-driven 3D animation using Three.js, a popular JavaScript 3D library.

The main features of this project include:

- Scroll-driven animation: The 3D scene responds to user scroll input, creating a dynamic and interactive experience.
- Easily configurable: You can customize the 3D model, camera settings, and animation properties to suit your project's needs.
- Well-organized structure: The project is structured to keep your code organized and maintainable.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhzamRasul/Scrollable-3D-Animation-with-Three.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Scrollable-3D-Animation-with-Three.js
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the project on a development server and open it in your default web browser. You can now view the scrollable 3D animation in action.

## Usage

This project serves as a starting point for creating your own scrollable 3D animations. To integrate it into your project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Customize the 3D model:**

   Replace the default 3D model in the `src/models` directory with your own model in the desired format (e.g., `.glb`, `.gltf`, etc.). Make sure to update the model path in the `src/scripts/scene.js` file.

2. **Customize the animation:**

   Adjust the animation logic in the `src/scripts/animation.js` file to match your desired behaviour. You can use Three.js animation techniques to create complex animations.

3. **Configure camera settings:**

   Modify the camera settings in the `src/scripts/camera.js` file to control the initial view and perspective of your 3D scene.

4. **Customize the scroll-triggered animations:**

   Implement scroll-triggered animations by editing the code in the `src/scripts/scroll.js` file. This is where you can define how the 3D scene reacts to scrolling.

5. **Build and integrate into your project:**

   After customizing the animation to your liking, you can build the project using `npm run build`. The compiled code will be available in the `dist` directory, which you can integrate into your web project.


## Customization

Feel free to customize this project to fit your specific requirements. You can add additional 3D objects, textures, and materials to create a unique and engaging scrollable 3D animation.
